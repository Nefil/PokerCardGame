# PokerCardGame

## Project Description

PokerCardGame is a console card game written in C#. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), design patterns (Strategy, Singleton), and the use of a local SQLite database to store game statistics. The game allows matches against AI opponents.

## Features

- Game skeleton: player classes, deck of cards, game mechanics
- AI opponents based on the Strategy pattern
- Saving game statistics in a local SQLite database file
- Example use of the Singleton pattern
- Project documentation in README

## Technologies

- C# (.NET)
- SQLite (local file database)
- Console user interface
- Design patterns: Strategy, Singleton

## Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nefil/PokerCardGame.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project and run the game from the console.

## Usage Example

Start the game, choose the number of players and opponent type (AI or human), and begin your match. Game statistics will be saved automatically in the SQLite database file.

## Potential Project Extensions

- Adding a graphical interface (e.g., WPF)
- Expanding game mechanics with new modes
- Match and statistics history
- **Allowing the user to change the game language** â€“ add language selection (e.g., Polish/English) in application settings, and use resource files for translating messages
- Exporting results to files
- Adding unit tests for game logic
- CI/CD integration (e.g., GitHub Actions)

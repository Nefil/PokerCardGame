# PokerCardGame

## Project Description

PokerCardGame is a console card game written in C#. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), design patterns (Strategy, Singleton), and the use of a local SQLite database to store game statistics. The game allows matches against AI opponents.

## Features

- Game skeleton: player classes, deck of cards, game mechanics
- AI opponents based on the Strategy pattern
- Saving game statistics in a local SQLite database file
- Example use of the Singleton pattern

## Technologies

- C# (.NET)
- SQLite (local file database)
- Console user interface
- Design patterns: Strategy, Singleton

## Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nefil/PokerCardGame.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project and run the game from the console.

## Potential Project Extensions

- Adding a graphical interface (e.g., WPF)
- Expanding game mechanics with new modes
- Match and statistics history
- **Allowing the user to change the game language** – add language selection (e.g., Polish/English) in application settings, and use resource files for translating messages
- Exporting results to files
- Adding unit tests for game logic
- CI/CD integration (e.g., GitHub Actions)
